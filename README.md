## About The REPO

This repoistory is a collaborative effort by the DCU - ADAPT Team for the
[EDOS 2023 SemEval Task-10](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/7124)
shared task.


## Getting Started



## Folder Structure


## Pre-requisites

Python3 modules:
gensim
nltk 
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
spacy
xgboost

(SpaCy is only needed if requesting its tokeniser with `train.py --tokeniser`,
or making predictions with a model that was trained with this option.)

NLTK asks to further run inside python:
```
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

Spacy instructions say to run
```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
TODO: do we need this model? We only use the tokeniser.
